Athena is a quick and easy to setup given that the data that you want to query is already in S3. 
There is no need configure how many nodes you want your database setup to have, because Athena works on a serverless model with no dedicated hardware needed. For general analytics, it provides a quick and painless way to setup an infrastructure, but performance wise falls short of Redshift when working with big data. For the ease of use and setup, Athena is a notable choice for companies looking to hit the ground running.
