Redshift is an OLAP type of database solution from AWS. Utilizing PostgreSQL, it brings analytical functions and aggregations apt for data analysis.
>By distributing the workload across available nodes, it is able to speed up read and aggregation functions compared to traditional database solutions. With the ability to scale into the petabyte range, it serves as the solution that has a high barrier to start, but worthwhile in use. Another interesting technology that stems from Redshift is Redshift Spectrum. Spectrum is able to query data stored in S3 while using dedicated nodes to coordinate and process the data. One main difference between Redshift Spectrum is that Athena is a serverless solution while Redshift Spectrum is not.
